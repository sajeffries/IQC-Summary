This folder includes .qc files which describe carry-lookahead (cla), and ripple carry (rca) adders. The text file adder_n.txt gives the output of t-par applied to adder_n.qc. There also exist two python files which create the code for new cla and rca adders, note that one must edit the file to change n. Also note that the rca have an extra unused bit, this helps with tdepth optimization.
